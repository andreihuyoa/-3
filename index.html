            <span class="highlight">Hey,</span> your message took me by surprise, but I appreciate you being honest and speaking what you feel. It's nice to hear you speak from the heart
        </div>
        <div class="highlight-2">
            To be honest with you I actually admire you, but my heart doesn't really beat the same way as yours at the moment. It's not you, not a reflection of your worth or sa ating dalawa; it's simply a matter of where my feelings lie, I'm detached. I've been trying to love myself for the longest time, continuously trying to get better and I am, but not with someone at the moment
        </div>
        <div class="highlight-3">
            I hope you understand that this doesn't change how much I cherish our friendship, and sana walang mag bago between us. I want nothing more than for us to continue laughing as what we've been doing for a while, and we can continue getting to know each other without the feelings. So, friends?
